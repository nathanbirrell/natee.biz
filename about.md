In 2002, I talked my Dad into buying me my first ever domain name:
[tsmithphotos.com](http://www.tsmithphotos.com). I used it to post my
early photography work until college, when I switched over to
[tsmithcreative.com](http://www.tsmithcreative.com/?utm_source=tsmithphotos&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=tsmithphotos)
for a professional
portfolio. For years, this domain sat empty, but I couldn't bear to
let it expire because of all the growth it represented in photography,
art, web development, and even personal branding.

But I was taking all these photos that just sat on my computer, mostly
unshared. What's the use in recording all of these images and trying
to grow my skills if I'm not going to share them with anyone? So it's
time to resurrect this domain. But how?

Early versions of this site used a horribly insecure PHP
auto-generated gallery script I wrote, then Dreamweaver-generated
sites, and eventually even a Flash-powered gallery I built that
ingested data from XML files. In keeping that spirit of using my web
development interest to support my photography hobby, I've
custom-built another solution for this site and I'll be releasing the
code on GitHub after I've cleaned it up a bit.

I've tried other photo services but none seemed to fit the spirit of
what I want out of this site. 500px seems to be for the top-quality
professional images, and it isn't free if you want to post more than a
small handful of photos. Behance is a great community but photo alumbs
weren't always easy to manage. Flickr seemed more accurate in spirit,
but my username is taken! But even that seemed inadequate after
[the Great West Coast Roadtrip]({% post_url 2015-08-29-GWR %}), where
I realized that sometimes I like to write stories about my adventures.

So here is TSmithPhotos, Version 7: a vacation-snapshot-accepting,
informal-blog-writing-friendly, web-development-playing,
just-for-friends-and-family site of things I've seen along the last
few years of adventures.

Thank you for looking.
