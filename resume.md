<h3>
  <span>Poseidon</span>
  <span class="tx-overline">
    2017 - 2018
  </span>
</h3>

A hobby project built with Ruby on Rails and a create-react-app + Typescript frontend. The goal: to improve the experience around surf forecast modelling. We had some fun challenges around presenting graphs and numerical data in a user-friendly way; storing and parsing model data and calculating a "Surf Potential" figure. Multiple third-party integrations involved (ie: NOAA, BOM).

<!-- Most of our time was spent on formulating the "Surf Potential" figure which took in a range of variables from different sources to calculate a rating (out of 10) of likelihood of good surf at a given location. Each surf spot is unique in the ideal conditions, so this made for a challenging project! -->

<!-- We decided to discontinue the project after some long-standing companies in the area vastly improved their offering and felt we couldn't add enough additional value. -->

<!-- ## Interests

1.  Heavy focus on best practices in software development: writing reusable, readable and maintainable code, continuous improvement and quality (through pull requests, pair programming and regular team catch-ups). Opinions heavily influenced by the [Rails Doctrine](http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/), [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and [Eloquent JS](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).
2.  Strong interest in wider front-end community involvement and contributing back to open source projects. Regular attendee at MelbJS and Ruby Melbourne meetups.
3.  Managing teams and workflows around building software. Inspired by many things/people, to name a few: [Agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), Lean philosophy, [Basecamp](https://m.signalvnoise.com/), [Ben Horowitz](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205), [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) and [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html).
