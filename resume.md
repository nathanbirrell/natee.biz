### [Poseidon](http://surfposeidon.io)

June 2017 - 2018

A side project with a friend, which involved a create-react-app + Typescript frontend and a Rails backend.

The goal for the project was to improve the experience around surf forecast modelling, so we had some fun challenges around presenting graphs and numerical data in a friendly way; storing and parsing model data and so on. Multiple third-party integrations involved, including: NOAA, BOM, PlanetOS and Willyweather.

We decided to discontinue the project after some longstanding companies in the area vastly improved their offering and felt we couldn't add enough additional value.

Opinions heavily influenced by the [Rails Doctrine](http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/), [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and [Eloquent JS](http://eloquentjavascript.net/).

3.  Managing teams and workflows around building software. Inspired by many things/people, to name a few: [Agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/), Lean philosophy, [Basecamp](https://m.signalvnoise.com/), [Ben Horowitz](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205), [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) and [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html).
