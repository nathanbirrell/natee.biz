<h2>Side Projects &amp; Volunteering</h2>

<h3>

<h3>
<span>Soulection 24/7 Radio App</span>

<span class="tx-overline">
  2021
</span>
</h3>

As a Soulection Radio listener, I made a little radio app to stream random episodes 24/7, with some Apple Music-esque [blurry animated backgrounds](/img/projects/future-beats/future-beats-367.gif) that match the episode cover and tablet-drawn player controls. This project was great to experiment with Tailwind CSS, drawing vectors on an iPad and integrating with SoundCloud's API.

<h3>
  <span>Poseidon</span>
  <span class="tx-overline">
    2017 - 2018
  </span>
</h3>

A hobby project built with Ruby on Rails and a create-react-app with a Typescript frontend. Our goal was to improve the experience around surf forecast modelling. We had some fun challenges around presenting graphs and numerical data in a user-friendly way; storing and parsing model data and calculating a "Surf Potential" figure. Multiple third-party integrations involved with NOAA, BOM and PlanetOS.

<!-- Most of our time was spent on formulating the "Surf Potential" figure which took in a range of variables from different sources to calculate a rating (out of 10) of likelihood of good surf at a given location. Each surf spot is unique in the ideal conditions, so this made for a challenging project! -->

<!-- We decided to discontinue the project after some long-standing companies in the area vastly improved their offering and felt we couldn't add enough additional value. -->
