## Services

### Website Design and Development

I design and build websites for small businesses. Sites are built on a range of content-management systems and frameworks, each being chosen depending on the project. All websites are responsive, so they are optimised to work on all devices. 

See my [Projects](/projects) for an example of some recent solutions.

### Search Engine Optimisation

SEO is a very cost-effective way for small businesses to get more exposure and find more leads. I work on new and existing sites to improve their SEO through the most appropriate methods for each business.

### Business Tools

Email, calendars and cloud storage are all critical to many small business operations. I help businesses set up and maintain these critical tools.

### Web Applications and Software Development

Custom applications built for businesses to improve both internal performance and customer experience. These types of projects are focused on continuously delivering business value, are generally run on an ongoing basis and are flexible to handle changes in business requirements.

I work with a range of languages, frameworks and technologies, tending to choose them appropriate to the project. My experience is in: Ruby on Rails, Wordpress, PHP and some Java.
