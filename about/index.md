## Services

### Websites

I build websites for client

See my [Projects](/projects) for an example of some recent solutions.


### Web Applications and Software Development

Custom applications built for businesses to improve both internal performance and customer experience. These types of projects are focused on continuously delivering business value, are generally run on an ongoing basis and are flexible to handle changes in business requirements.

I work with a range of languages, frameworks and technologies, tending to choose them appropriate to the project. My experience is in: Ruby on Rails, Wordpress, PHP and some Java.
