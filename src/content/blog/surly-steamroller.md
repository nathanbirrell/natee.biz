_Updated March 2023_

A plush and cruisey track bike.

My goal for this build was a fun, comfortable and low-maintenance commuter. From the chunky 47mm tyres to the steel risers, this definitely fits the bill. As I update this in 2023, the bike has not been touched in the way of maintenance (I agree with Paul on this, [bikes like this don't need maintenance](https://youtu.be/lzcCbjlEaXE)).

Functionality aside, I'm obsessed with raw steel. This frame started life as a ["Skidmark Brown"](https://surlybikes.com/uploads/downloads/Surly_2007_Cat.pdf) which just wasn't going to cut it. So it was promptly taken to the local sandblaster, for a plastic media blast. From there it went to the powder coater for a matte clear coat[^1].

From the start I knew it would be a brakeless build, which opened up my wheel build part-finding options for the 650B wheelset on the second-hand marketplaces. If you want to run brakes, I found there are surprisingly few 650B rim-brake rims around nowadays. You'd also need to look at some long-reach brakes to compensate for the smaller wheel diameter.
