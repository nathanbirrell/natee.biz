### Soulection 24/7 Radio App (2021)

As a listener of the radio program, I made a little radio app to stream random episodes 24/7, with some Apple Music-esque [blurry animated backgrounds](/img/projects/future-beats/future-beats-367.gif) that match the episode cover and tablet-drawn player controls. This project was great to experiment with Tailwind CSS, drawing vectors on an iPad and integrating with SoundCloud's API.

### Poseidon (2017 â€” 2018)

A hobby project built with Ruby on Rails and a create-react-app with a Typescript frontend. Our goal was to improve the experience around surf forecast modelling. We had some fun challenges around presenting graphs and numerical data in a user-friendly way; storing and parsing model data and calculating a "Surf Potential" figure. Multiple third-party integrations involved with NOAA, BOM and PlanetOS.

Most of our time was spent on formulating the "Surf Potential" figure which took in a range of variables from different sources to calculate a rating (out of 10) of likelihood of good surf at a given location. Each surf spot is unique in the ideal conditions, so this made for a challenging project.

We decided to discontinue the project after some long-standing companies in the area vastly improved their offering and felt we couldn't add enough additional value.
