- Introduced **trunk-based git workflow** with feature flagging and commit conventions to achieve smaller changesets, more focussed code reviews and quicker release cycles.

- Ownership of long-term strategy for a production frontend app, using **Typescript and React**, a component library (**Storybook**) and a backend API service (**AWS Lambda**, AppSync).
- Architected and built a backend-for-frontend project. This simplified interfacing with microservices through one **GraphQL API**, leveraging highly scalable event-driven, serverless architecture.
