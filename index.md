**I build digital applications for small businesses to help them improve.** 

Most of my work is web-based, however, my skills are quite varied: I have experience in web development — both front-end and server-side — as well as graphic design and QA.

Please [email me](mailto:{{site.email}}) to find out how I can help your business.
