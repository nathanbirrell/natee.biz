[Serenity Face and Body](http://serenityfaceandbody.com.au) is a beauty salon located in Burwood, Victoria. We chose to set Serenity up for two reasons: it's easy to use CMS and the affordability of it's quality out-of-the box designs.

## My work

My work for Serenity involved:

* Migrating content from an old web server, to a new Squarespace site.
* Setup of a new email server and migration of accounts to that one.
