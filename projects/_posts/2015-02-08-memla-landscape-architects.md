[Memla](http://www.memla.net) is an Australian landscape architecture firm, located in Melbourne. The company brought me in to design and build their new website to presenting their project folio to prospect clients, with an emphasis on photography.

## My work

My work for Memla involved:

* Architecting the website's user experience.
* Designing the visual elements of the website.
* Developing the website.
* Provisioning and deploying to a new web server.
* Supporting and updating the site on an ongoing basis.
