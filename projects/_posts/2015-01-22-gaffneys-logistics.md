[Gaffneys](http://gaffneys.com.au) is an Australian logistics and transport small business, located in Sydney and Melbourne. The company brought me in to design and build their website from scratch, with a focus on refreshing their online presence and making it responsive (compatible on all devices).

## My work

My work for Gaffneys involved:

* Architecting the website's user experience.
* Designing the visual elements of the website.
* Developing the website.
* Provisioning and deploying to a new web server.

### Behind the scenes

The project was built in [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) to give Gaffneys the flexibility of experimenting with an in-house application that could improve their operational processes. The front-end of the website was built on [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com). Images used are a combination of my photography on-site, stock images and the company's own.
